Crunch!

Crunch is part of this complete breakfast.

Compiling / Testing a Crunch branch
-----------------------------------

Crunch runs on Adobe AIR. Get the Adobe AIR SDK, and simply do "adl application.xml" on the command line (when you've set up your environments path to the adl executable) to test edits to Crunch. 

Then be all like, "Whaaaaaat?" and your computer will be all like, "Aw yeah, that's some Crunchy action you got goin'."
