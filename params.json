{"name":"Crunch","body":"### Crunch!\r\nEveryone loves LESS. After all, who isn't tired of typing all the browser prefixes to make some kick-ass CSS3? But don't you wish you could organize your LESS/CSS styles into some well-organized libraries, and then just serve a single file to the browser? Or render your page without relying on JavaScript or command-line geekery? Wouldn't it be great if you could just edit LESS, and then save CSS?\r\n\r\nThanks for asking. Yes, it would be great, and that's why we made Crunch. To make your life great. Just because.\r\n\r\n### Compiling / Testing a Crunch branch\r\nCrunch runs on Adobe AIR. Get the Adobe AIR SDK, and simply do \"adl application.xml\" on the command line (when you've set up your environments path to the adl executable) to test edits to Crunch.\r\n\r\nThen be all like, \"Whaaaaaat?\" and your computer will be all like, \"Aw yeah, that's some Crunchy action you got goin'.\"","tagline":"The LESS editor and compiler that almost makes it too easy.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
